/// A widget that drives an [AnimationController] when scrolling into view.
///
/// You must provide an [AnimationController]. This widget will listen to
/// that controller to know when to rebuild its contents based on the
/// provided `builder` function. When that widget enters and exits the
/// scrollview, it will drive the animation by calling `forward()` and
/// `reverse()` on that controller.
/// 
/// To change the criteria for when a widget is considered to have entered, see
/// `EntrancePolicy`. Defaults to animating whenever any part of the child has
/// become visible.
/// 
/// For performance reasons, you may specify a `child` widget which is not
/// rebuilt on animation. This is then passed into the `builder` callback.
/// 
/// To wrap another sliver (instead of a non-sliver Box widget)  with an
/// entrance animation, provide a `sliverBuilder` callback instead of a
/// `builder` callback.
